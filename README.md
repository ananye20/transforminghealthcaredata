Transforming healthcare data into actionable insights through interactive visualizations and analytics. This repository provides tools to analyze medical spending, hospital performance, and claim patterns for better decision-making.


## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Medicare spending data in the USA, providing interactive dashboards to explore spending trends across various dimensions. The primary goal is to deliver actionable insights to inform budget allocation decisions in the healthcare sector.

## Main Features
- **Medicare Spending Analysis Dashboard**: Interactive Tableau dashboards to examine spending patterns.
- **Medicare Spending Storyline**: Storytelling for hosipital expenditure.
- **State-wise & Period-wise Breakdown**: Insights into spending before, during, and after hospitalization.
- **Hospital Outlier Detection**: Identification of hospitals exhibiting unusual spending behaviors.
- **Claim Type Distribution**: Categorization of spending across inpatient, skilled nursing, and carrier claims.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Grouping hospitals based on their average spending per episode.


## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and transformation tasks using libraries like pandas.
- **Excel**: For constructing correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive data visualizations and dashboards, including geospatial analyses and clustering.

## Setup & Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Upload the csv file into Google colab or Jupyter Notebook
    - Use Python scripts with pandas, NumPy, and seaborn to preprocess and clean the data. Code mentioned in the document.
    - Construct a correlation matrix in Excel to analyze relationships between variables.
2. **Visualization**:
    - Load the preprocessed data into Tableau
    - Use Tableau to create interactive dashboards, including spatial maps and tree maps.
    - Apply clustering algorithms in Tableau to identify distinct groups based on spending patterns.
    - Construct box and whisker plots to identify and examine outlier hospitals in each state.
  
## Use Cases
- **Budget Allocation:** Identify regions with high and low spending to allocate resources effectively.
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare metrics across hospitals and states to set performance standards.
- **Policy Development:** Utilize data-driven insights to inform healthcare policies and interventions.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Detect inefficiencies and optimize operations within healthcare facilities.
